# Big Data Assignments

## Introduction

The objective of this work is to help students to put into practice the concepts learnt during the theory lessons, and to get proficiency in the use of Spark and other related Big Data technologies. In this exercise, the students are required to develop a Spark application that creates a machine learning model for a real-world problem, using real-world data: Predicting the arrival delay of commercial flights.
